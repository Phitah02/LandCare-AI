# TODO: Implement Historical Analysis, Statistical Table, and Forecasting

## Completed Steps

### âœ… Step 1: Update Dependencies
- Dependencies already present in requirements.txt (scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, statsmodels).

### âœ… Step 2: Create Forecasting Module
- Created backend/forecasting.py with ARIMA models for NDVI and weather forecasting.

### âœ… Step 3: Extend GEE Processor
- Added get_historical_ndvi() function to query NDVI over past N years with monthly averages.

### âœ… Step 4: Enhance Weather Integration
- Added get_historical_weather() using GEE ERA5 for historical rainfall/temperature data.
- Added functions to compute temperature anomalies and average monthly rainfall.

### âœ… Step 5: Update Database Models
- Added methods in models.py to store and retrieve historical NDVI, weather, and forecast data.

### âœ… Step 6: Add New API Endpoints
- Added /historical/ndvi endpoint for historical NDVI data.
- Added /historical/weather endpoint for historical weather data.
- Added /forecast/ndvi endpoint for NDVI forecasting.
- Added /forecast/weather endpoint for weather forecasting.
- Added /history/<user_id> endpoint to retrieve user's analysis history.

## Remaining Steps

### ðŸ”„ Step 7: Update Frontend
- Modify frontend/js/app.js and map-handler.js to display historical charts, statistical tables, and forecasts.
- Add UI components for historical data visualization.
- Add forecast display components.

### âœ… Step 8: Install Dependencies
- All dependencies installed successfully in virtual environment.

### âœ… Step 9: Test Implementation
- Backend server starts without errors.
- All new endpoints implemented and integrated.
- Dependencies installed successfully.
- All endpoints tested successfully:
  - /analyze returns NDVI, land cover, and risk assessment
  - /historical/ndvi returns historical NDVI data
  - /forecast/ndvi returns NDVI forecasts
  - /health endpoint confirms GEE initialization
- Code ready for frontend integration and full testing.

## New Endpoints Added
- POST /historical/ndvi - Get historical NDVI data
- GET /historical/weather/<lat>/<lon> - Get historical weather data
- POST /forecast/ndvi - Forecast NDVI
- GET /forecast/weather/<lat>/<lon> - Forecast weather
- GET /history/<user_id> - Get user history
